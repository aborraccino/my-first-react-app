# My first React App

This is my first experimental usage of React library to build a SPA (Single page application).

Inspiration taken from this introduction online course on Pluralsight:
- [What is React](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-what-is/)
- [Github repo](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-what-is-react)

This project contains two folders:
- [myapp-no-toolchain](/myapp-no-toolchain/README.md): it contains two simple SPAs pages, one using only Javascript, the other one using the React libraries without any toolchain such NextJs.
- [myapp](/myapp/README.md): it contains a simple SPAs page using the NextJs framework.
