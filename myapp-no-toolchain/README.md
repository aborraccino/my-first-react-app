# Javascript SPA vs React SPA

This folder contains two SPAs pages:

- [SPA-JS.html](SPA-JS.html)
- [SPA-React-no-JSX.html](SPA-React-no-JSX.html)

They both dynamically modify the HTML DOM in order to render a list of numbers in the page within a div element. *SPA-JS.html* just uses plain Javascript while *SPA-React-no-JSX.html* uses React libraries, without using any toolchain framework and the JSX syntax.

## Run locally
The file **index.html** can be opened using a broweser and contains two links to the two diffent pages.

### Dynamic reloading with Live Server extensions
Visual Studio code has an extensions called **Live Server** which allow to automatically launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages. 

A local web server is spin up at the url http://127.0.0.1:5500

It might be very useful for the development purpose.
